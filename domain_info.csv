Quality Management,"The Quality Management workspace is a workspace dedicated to working with Teamcenter Quality
applications. The tile in the Quality Applications section in the Quality Management workspace lets
you work with your application."
Naming conventions,"Naming conventions are used to organize the Quality Characteristics and Characteristic Groups that are
generated when you import product and manufacturing information (PMI) from a part. The naming
pattern in the naming convention is based on the attributes of the Quality Characteristics. These Quality
Characteristics are generated and added to a Characteristic Group, whose Characteristic Type and name
you define in the naming convention in the Quality Master Data library. The name of the Characteristic
Group is a combination of the attributes and the delimiter defined in the naming convention."
Edit a naming convention,"After creating a naming convention, you can edit it to add, rearrange, or remove attributes; change
the delimiter; or update its name and description. After you edit and save the naming convention, the
updates are reflected in all Quality Characteristics that are created with this naming convention.
1. On the HOME page, click the QUALITY MASTER DATA tile.
2. In the Quality Master Data location, click the Characteristics Library page.
3. In the left pane, click Characteristics and Rule Engine in the Work area toolbar.
4. In the Characteristics and Rule Engine panel, click Naming Convention."
Delete a naming convention,"You can delete a naming convention only if it is not used in a rule or assigned as a default naming
convention.
1. On the HOME page, click the QUALITY MASTER DATA tile.
2. In the Quality Master Data location, click the Characteristics Library page."
Create a naming rule to process the imported PMI,"Naming rules process the product and manufacturing information (PMI) from a part’s 3D/2D data to
create Quality Characteristics based on naming conventions. In the naming rule, you can create multiple
conditions based on the attributes of PMI. You must also define a default naming convention for creating
Quality Characteristics. The default naming convention is used when any of the naming rule conditions
are not met. By default, you can use the available attributes of PMIs from BCT Inspector to create
conditions in the naming rule. If required, you can configure Control Plan to display more BCT Inspector
attributes through Business Modeler Integrated Development Environment (BMIDE).
By default, an active naming rule is available after installing Control Plan. This naming rule has a default
naming convention for creating Variable Quality Characteristics, and no conditions are defined for the
rule."
Edit a naming rule,"rearrange, or remove attributes and conditions in the RULE BUILDER section.
1. On the HOME page, click the QUALITY MASTER DATA tile.
2. In the Quality Master Data location, click the Characteristics Library page.

Activate a naming rule,"After creating a naming rule, you must activate it for the naming rule to be used to process the imported
PMI. You can have only one active rule at a time. When you activate a new rule, the existing rule is
deactivated.
1. On the HOME page, click the QUALITY MASTER DATA tile.
2. In the Quality Master Data location, click the Characteristics Library page.

Quality Characteristics,"Quality Characteristics are the attributes of a Part or Process that must be monitored during
manufacturing to deliver a high-quality product. You can create the following types of Quality
Characteristics:
• Variable: Defines the specific values to be measured, including the nominal values, its tolerance
values, and the unit of measure.
• Attributive: Defines which attributes are acceptable in the OK Condition field and the ones that are
unacceptable in the Not OK Condition field.
• Visual: Specifies the images of the defects that can occur or standard specification images."
